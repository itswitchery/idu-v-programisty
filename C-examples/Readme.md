To build C examples, you need to have a C compiler installed. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install the GNU C compiler with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential
``` 

To build the examples, run the following command from the root of the repository:

```bash
gcc draw-figure.c -o draw-figure
```

This will create an executable file called `draw-figure` in the same directory. You can run it with the following command:

```bash
./draw-figure
```
